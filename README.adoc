= personal-notes

A repo of my notes that is about anything that is not too detailed 
to talk about anything, really.

If you want to find my detailed notes on anything that I don't know, you can find it 
https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/a-remote-repo-full-of-notes-of-things-i-do-not-know-about[here].
Bear in mind that unlike this repo which contains `.adoc` files, the
previously linked repo contains LaTeX files which means you need to 
have a LaTeX distribution to compile it. 
If you're not familiar with LaTeX, I've written more about it how 
you can compile it yourself in the said repo.

For now, enjoy my whatever-the-crap-that-is-put-in-here. Like with the 
remote repo full of notes of things I do not know, the notes here are 
written with the priniciple of https://collegeinfogeek.com/feynman-technique/[Feynman technique].
At the very least, you could find something useful here.
