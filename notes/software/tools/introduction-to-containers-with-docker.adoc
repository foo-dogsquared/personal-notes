Containerizing your application has been a trend and proposed as a way of deploying your software. 
In this simple note, we'll take a peek what is containerization with the help of https://www.docker.com/[Docker] and what we can do with it. 

NOTE: For future references, the version I'm using for this note is Docker 19.03.8, Community Edition. 




== What are containers? 

A container is a package containing the project and its dependencies to run in an isolated virtual system. 
This allows to run anywhere uniformly regardless of the setup its running on, eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem. 

It can be another way of shipping your software and is especially useful if the project is built with multiple software â€” e.g., a project composed of an API server built with Ruby, a frontend built with PHP, and a database with MariaDB. footnote:[The example is an overkill but you get the idea.] 

The nature of setting an isolated virtual environment can create comparisons between a container and a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine[virtual machine] (VM). 
On a quick note, let's clear that up. 

Virtual machines are often made as a hardware abstraction and usually emulate entire operating systems along with its own app, drivers, kernel, and everything in between. 
Thus, they often take some time; 
not to mention the space for each installation that usually takes from a few hundred megabytes up to a few gigabytes. 
Containers, on the other hand, only https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization[emulates the image at operating system level] thus reducing the overhead and resources needed for them to boot. 

With containers, it is easier to create a consistent environment that all developers can work with even if their current setup is all different from one another. 
The developers can just pull the image, create the container instance, change it from their local setup, and push it back for testing. 
Or it could be used for deploying your services with multiple containers and all of them work will the same as you configured from your local machine. 




== A gander of containers through Docker 

To get into the world of containers, we'll use Docker as it is one of the most popular platform for managing containers. 
In fact, it could be said that Docker is the de facto tool for software containers. 
The company behind it spearheaded the development of containerization and has created a https://www.opencontainers.org/[standard for software containers]. 

Docker works similarly to popular VM tools like https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] or https://www.qemu.org/[QEMU] that it creates virtual environments from an **image**. 
Each image can run multiple instances of itself called **containers**. 

Assuming Docker is already installed, let's start up the application. 
What keeps Docker running is its backend called the Docker Engine. 
The engine runs in a server-client model with a daemon (server) and a CLI (client). 
The daemon does the heavy work of managing Docker objects such as images, containers, and a few others which we'll see in a moment. 
The client and the server communicates through a REST API. 

Let's demonstrate one simple trick with Docker. 
First, let's simply boot up an https://alpinelinux.org/[Alpine Linux] image since it's a distro that focuses on simplicity. 
footnote:[Alpine Linux is also the distro of https://training.play-with-docker.com[Training with Docker] for the same reason.] 

NOTE: You may have to execute the `docker` with superuser privileges unless you've configured the service (i.e., https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/[for Linux]). 

[source, shell]
----
docker container run alpine hostname 
----

This will create and run a container from an image named `alpine` from our local list of images and execute the `hostname` command. 
If the `alpine` image does not exist, it will pull the image from its https://hub.docker.com/[online repositories] instead which will likely be the case. 
Each of the container will have a container ID and a name for easy referencing. 

After the command has exited, the container will go to an exit state and will remain until it is removed. 
You can see this container is still in the daemon with `docker container ls --all`. 
To remove this container in the list, we can simply remove it with `docker container rm <NAME>`. 

It would easier if we want to remove this automatically after the exit. 
Fortunately, there is an easy way by simply adding the `--rm` flag when running the container (e.g., `docker container run --rm alpine hostname`). 

It would great if we could see how far Docker emulates the virtual environment. 
Fortunately, there is a way with the following command. 

[source, shell]
----
docker container run --interactive --tty --rm alpine sh
----

Here we have seen two additional options: 

* `--interactive` creates an interactive session. 
* `--tty` creates a https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4126/what-is-the-exact-difference-between-a-terminal-a-shell-a-tty-and-a-con[TTY]. 

The first two options would enable interaction with the container with its shell. 
You can then execute commands such as `uname -a`, `cat /etc/issue`, and `ps aux` as an indicator for testing how well the virtual environment is. 




== Containerizing your programs

Now that we have introduced containers with minimal interaction, what now? 
The practical pointer from here is to show containerization of your applications. 

Containerizing enables your program to be portable and easy-to-use like a canned tuna with a pull-tab. 
The best thing with tools like Docker is it doesn't interfere with the already existing setup. 

For example, we'll containerize https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/personal-notes/[this repo] by adding a Dockerfile to the project root. 
footnote:[There is a https://github.com/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor/[Docker image] for Asciidoctor but we'll pretend it doesn't exist for the sake of example.] 
The https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/[Dockerfile] is a specific file for Docker that contains the metadata for our customized container. 

In our to-be-containerized project, we use the following dependencies: 

* https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[GNU Make] 
* https://www.ruby-lang.org/[Ruby] 
* https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] 
* http://slim-lang.com/[Slim] 
* Some fonts

Great! 
Now that we listed the dependencies, it's time to get started in creating the container. 

The base image of our container would use https://www.alpinelinux.org/[Alpine Linux] since our required installation is quite minimal and Alpine Linux is a fit for that while offering a variety of tools with its https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management[package manager]. 

[source, dockerfile]
----
FROM alpine <.>

<.>
# Install main dependencies
RUN apk add --no-cache \
    font-bakoma-ttf \
    make \
    ruby \
    ruby-mathematical \
    ruby-rake \
    ttf-liberation \
    ttf-dejavu

# Install Ruby packages
RUN apk add --no-cache --virtual .rubymakedepends \
    ruby-dev \
    && gem install asciidoctor slim thread_safe rouge tilt \
    && apk del -r --no-cache .rubymakedepends

# Create a `project` directory where this will project will be stored. <.>
WORKDIR /project
----

It is slightly self-explanatory but there are a couple of things we may not know here. 

<.> Basing our container from the Alpine Linux image which is one of the go-to choices for minimal Linux installations. 

<.> Installing dependencies of our project. 
Since we're using Alpine Linux, we have to use their package manager. 

<.> Create a directory in `/project` where the project is stored. 

Now that we have our Dockerfile set, we now have our setup containerized but we should see it for ourselves if it's working. 
To access our containerized program, we have to build the project image first. 

[source, shell]
----
docker image build --tag personal-notes:1.0 .
----

In the containerized program, we're supposed to bind our project filesystem into the container with a https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/198590[bind mount]. 
Fortunately, Docker can support just that with the following command. 

[source, shell]
----
docker container run --interactive --tty --rm --name personal-notes --mount type=bind,source=`pwd`,target=/project personal-notes:1.0
----

It should create a container and immediately run a shell with `/project` as the present working directory (as configured from the Dockerfile). 
From there, you can now do whatever you want. 
Install Vim and edit the documents, compile the output, or just hit `make` and be done with it. 

The only noticeable thing in the given command is the `--mount` option which requires some verbose arguments. 
Though in our example, it should be self-explanatory. 
If you need some understanding of the `--mount` option, https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/[there is a page that explains it]. 

Congratulations! 
You've containerized my personal notes setup and tasted what containerization is mostly about. 




== Where to go from here? 

The answer is the same as my usual answer for life-related questions: "It depends." 
If you're wanting to dig deeper into containers, you may want to look into https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/microservices[microservice architecture] where it demonstrates how containers can be useful in various setups. 
You can create a practical example such as making a multi-service application stack or splitting an already existing monolith application into individual services just glued together. 

https://training.play-with-docker.com/[Play with Docker classroom] pretty much sums it up what you can do with Docker (and validates why this note shouldn't exist as a general source of info).
