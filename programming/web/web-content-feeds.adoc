= Web content feeds

I know that web feeds exist but I've never closely examined them until I develop my https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-arch-terminal[own Hugo theme]. 

Here's my notes on the matter. 




== What are web feeds?

They are an easy way of keeping up with the updates of a website and making your content available to other sites/programs (web syndication). 
When we talk about the internals, they are simply files describing the content of a website. 

You can certainly manually create one but most of these feeds are automatically generated to easily update the content, prevent human errors, and avoid outdated information. 

They are mostly used by content aggregators and feed readers to gather and show you the available content of a website. 

The https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html[RSS] and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287[Atom] feeds are the leading formats for web content feeds but other data formats such as CSV and https://jsonfeed.org/version/1[JSON] are used as well. 




== Other uses 

Web feeds are also used as a tool for migration between publication platforms like 
https://dev.to/[dev.to] and https://medium.com/[Medium]. 

That said, it is also used for easy spreading of your content to different platforms. 
This also prevents you from copy-pasting your post and preventing your cross-posted content to be flagged as spam by web robots. 

NOTE: Of course, this depends on how well the publication platform integrates well with web feeds. 

For example, in dev.to, you can cross-post your blog by setting your RSS link from the "Publishing from RSS" section in the settings. 
Depending on how well the RSS feed was made and how close it complies from the https://dev.to/p/publishing_from_rss_guide[dev.to RSS publication guide], you can easily publish your content on the platform. 
It also sets the appropriate SEO tags for your content to be shareable on social platforms like Twitter and Facebook.
