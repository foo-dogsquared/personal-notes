This note will tackle the utility of a hotkey daemon (specifically the SXHKD) and how to quickly use it. 
Think of this note as a simple user guide. 
footnote:[Though, I really recommend to read the manual instead since it is pretty clear. I'm just writing this one for some reason...] 

For future references, the version of the program is at `0.6.0-3-g7124055` (as is the output from `{name} -version`. 

Simple X Hotkey Daemon (`{name}`) is self-explanatory as it is. 
It is basically a hotkey server for X11-based environments allowing to create universal hotkey bindings. 
It is a pretty useful utility that can integrate easily for most of the Linux-based setups. 




== How to start 

Starting to use `{name}` is easy enough. 
It needs a configuration file at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/{name}/{name}rc by default`. 
Though, you can still have config files at other locations with the `-c` option â€” i.e., `{name} -c PATH_TO_THE_CONFIG_FILE. 

The syntax for its configuration is simple and readable on its own. 
Let's take a look at a real-life example (which is a part of https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/dotfiles/blob/master/sxhkd/sxhkdrc[my own {name} config]. 

[source, sxhdrc]
----
# Basic binds (inspired from the previous i3 config). 
super + Return 
    $TERMINAL

# A dropdown terminal. 
# Requires tmux and tdrop for this to work. 
super + shift + Return
    tdrop -ma -w -4 -y "$PANEL_HEIGHT" -s dropterm $TERMINAL

super + q
    $TERMINAL -e ranger

super + t
    $HOME/bin/toggle-bin screenkey

# Kill the focused window. 
super + shift + q
    bspc node -c
----

Once you have a config file at the ready, you can then execute the program. 
Take note that `{name}` does not watch the config file. 
It will only have its keybindings at the time of execution. 

To update, you can simply kill the process and restart it. 
Fortunately, you can also send a `USR1` signal to the process and it will reload the config. 

In my configuration, I have a simple keybinding with the following command to simply reload the config for convenience. 

[source, sxhkdrc]
----
shift + super + r
    pkill -USR1 sxhkd && notify-send "SXHKD config has successfully reloaded." 
----

Another way of easily reloading is simply executing the command when you're saving it in Vim. 




== Configuration

Now let's take a closer look at the configuration. 

There are simply three main rules when it comes to parsing the config file. 
As said from the manual: 

* If the line is empty or starts with `#`, it is ignored (i.e., a comment). 
* If the line starts with a space, it is a **command**. 
* Otherwise, the line is read as a **hotkey**. 

Let's start with the main starting point when configuring {name}: the hotkeys. 

A hotkey is basically a keyboard shortcut. 
Each hotkey can only have one command which is basically entered as you would in the (default) shell. 
footnote:[Since it is not possible to do multiple commands similar to GNU Make, you can simply create a shell script for that.] 

There are certain names to refer to commonly used special keys such as `super`, `meta`, `alt`, `shift`, and `control`/`ctrl`. 
You can also view the common keys and their names by running `xmodmap`. 

For the obscure and uncommon keys, you can use the keysym output from running `xev` (with the `-event keyboard` option to make your life easier). 

For mouse events, you can refer to it with `button1`, `button2, `button3`, and so on. 

By default, the commands are executed during the key press event which can be dangerous on certain situations. 
You can change it to run on key release simply by adding a `@` in front of the keysym. 


=== Key chords 

One of the greatest things about {name} is enabling you to create **key chords** (or chord chains) similar to https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/[Emacs], https://www.vim.org/[Vim], and https://code.visualstudio.com/[VS Code] shortcuts. 

Let's take a look at this example. 

[source, sxhkdrc]
----
super + a ; f
    firefox

super + a ; t
    thunderbird

super + a ; c
    code
----

To create a key chord, simply the hotkeys with a semicolon (`;`). 

In the example config, it simply bind `Super + a` and an additional key to open certain applications. 

To open Firefox, simply press `Super + a` then `f`. 
For Thunderbird, `Super + a` then `t` and so on. 
In my workflow, this is inspired from https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#binding_modes[i3 modes]. 

On a similar note to i3 modes, you can cancel a key chord with the Escape key. 

In our examples where we could have multiple applications to bind, we could simply list all in a separate hotkey rule in the config. 

[source, sxhkdrc]
----
super + a ; z
    zathura

super + a ; x
    vim

super + a ; c
    code

super + a ; v
    inkscape

super + a ; b
    blender

super + a ; n
    lmms

super + a ; f
    firefox

super + a ; t
    thunderbird
----

As you can see, this can be pretty tedious. 
Fortunately, {name} has a way of condensing this into a concise form with sequences. 

[source, sxhkdrc]
----
super + a ; {z, x, c, v, b, n, f, t}
    { zathura, vim, code, inkscape, blender, lmms, firefox, thunderbird }
----

If you want to represent an empty sequence element, you can use the underscore (`_`). 
This can be useful to set optional key sequences and/or command strings. 

Here's a real-life example of the feature. 
This is based from my own config. 

[source, sxhkdrc]
----
{_, control +} {_,shift +} Print
    $HOME/bin/screenshot {_,--select} {_,--delay 3}
----

The above configuration example is the equivalent of the following. 

[source, sxhkdrc]
----
{shift +} Print
    $HOME/bin/screenshot {--delay 3}

control + {shift + } Print
    $HOME/bin.screenshot --select {--delay 3}
----

This maps to the following combinations of hotkeys with the resulting commands: 

* `Print` - `$HOME/bin/screenshot`
* `Shift + Print` - `$HOME/bin/screenshot --delay 3`
* `Control + Print` - `$HOME/bin/screenshot --select`
* `Control + Shift + Print` - `$HOME/bin/screenshot --select --delay 3`
